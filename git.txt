Git hub how to:

1. Create a git hub account
2. create a repository on github , name it and add a description
3. On local machine, from the directory you want to commit do the following:
- Make sure you are on the branch you want to commit, check the branch by running "git branch" and move to the branch you want by using "git checkout <branch_name>"
- Check if a remote repo already exsist for this branch by running "git remote". If none exsist create a remote by "git add remote <remote_name> <path from the gitHub>. If this is the first and only remote for this repo name it 'origin' like so:
git add remote origin <path>
and then
git remote -v (for verbose to verify the path)
- add the local changes by add to the stage area 'git add'
- commit the added changed 'git commit -m "<message>"'
- verify the commit with 'git log' or with 'git status'
- push the commit to the gitHub like so:
git push <remote_name> <branch_name> 
e.g - git push origin master
4. Verify the commit is present on the gitHub
